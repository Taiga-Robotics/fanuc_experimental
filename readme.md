Experimental packages for Fanuc manipulators within [ROS-Industrial][].
See the [fanuc][] repository and the [ROS wiki][] page for more information.


## Contents

This repository contains packages that will be migrated to the [fanuc][]
repository after they have received sufficient testing. The contents of
these packages are subject to change, without prior notice. Any available
APIs are to be considered unstable and are not guaranteed to be complete
and / or functional.


## Status

The packages in this repository are *community supported*.
This means they do not get support from the OEM, nor from the ROS-Industrial consortia directly (see also the `support level` badge at the top of this page).

Maintenance and development is on a best-effort basis and depends on volunteers.

If you are looking for official support, ask your local Fanuc branch office for their version of the ROS 1 fanuc driver.
